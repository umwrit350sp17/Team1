**Step 3** - Find the FocusWriter document you would like to open. The example file used in this instruction is the "Document 1" created in Section 9. Note how the file type shows "OpenDocument Text". This is a quick way of telling whether or not your document was created in FocusWriter. Select the document, and click "OK" or "Accept" when prompted by your new word processor.
