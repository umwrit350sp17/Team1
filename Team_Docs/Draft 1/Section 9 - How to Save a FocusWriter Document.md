Step 1 - To want to "save" a document, you should first have typed something into it! Go ahead and type anything into your new document!

Step 2 - To quickly save a file, click on the "floppy disc" icon on the top left-hand corner of your screen.

Step 3 - After clicking on the "floppy disc", you will be prompted to give your new document a title. This document has been titled "Document 1". After you have given it a title, click "OK". NOTE: If your document already has a title, (if it has been previously saved through this step, or in the following step) then clicking on the "floppy disc" again will not prompt you to give it another title. Rather, it will simply save the updated document.

Step 4 - There is another way to save files, other than clicking on the "floppy disc". For this example, you may want to open up a new document.

Step 5 - Mouse over "file" in the top left-hand corner of your screen, and then go down to "save as". Click on "save as".

Step 6 - Once again, you will be prompted to title your document. Click "OK" to accept the title of your document.

Step 7 - Additionally, if you have multiple sessions open at once, you can mouse over "File" in the top left-hand corner of your screen, and then go down to the "save all" option. Assuming that each of your sessions have been titled, you can click this button to save all of your sessions at once.
