FocusWriter is an open-source program that offers a distraction-free, word-processing environment. The program is best used for writing and drafting the initial stages of a document, especially for those who are prone to procrastination or distractions. 

FocusWriter's unique, borderless theme allows one to focus entirely on the page. Borders have been removed, and one must use the ALT+TAB function to withdraw into other sections of their computer. This hinders the ability for one to mindlessly stop what they are doing, and peruse the internet and social media.

The focus of this project is on how one would get started in using FocusWriter. In the following files, one will learn how to download and install FocusWriter, how to create documents in FocusWriter, how to open these documents in other word processors, and how to perform other FocusWriter tasks.

We hope that, with the use of the instructions included in the following files, that FocusWriter may quickly become your go-to wordprocessor for all of your academic needs.

Thank you!
Lauren, Katrina, and Jessica.
