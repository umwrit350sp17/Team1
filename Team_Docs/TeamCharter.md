# Team Charter

## Broad Goals:
  1. To present an informative and visually pleasing project concerning a Freshman-year student's use for the open-source program FocusWriter.
  2. To become better writers, collaborators, and distance-project doer's!


## Measurable Goals:
  1. To be consistent in communication; to respond in a timely manner to team members' comments and requests.
  2. To meet all deadlines.


## Personal Goals:

* Katrina
  1. I would like to have a positive and productive team enivorment.
  2. Also, I want to improve my technical writing skills and learn markdown skills.
  3. Finally, I want to do my fair share of work in a timely manner.
  
* Lauren
  1. My biggest goal for this project is to become more comfortable with online group projects. I have never worked on a project before where I have not personally met my team members!
  2. I want to improve upon my informative writing skills, so that in the future I can easily and professionally prepare written instructions for how-to tasks.
  3. I also hope to become more comfortable with using GitHub as a collaborative platform, because I see myself using it for future projects.

## Individual Commitment:

* Katrina: I plan to put forth my best effort and my fair share of the project. I will listen to my fellow teams members' ideas and work collaboratively. 

* Lauren: I love working with others, especially for creative and collaborative projects such as this one. I have a heavy background in grammar and drafting research papers, so I plan on using all of my knowledge to best help the team to create a well-researched and well-written presentation.

* Jessica:

## Concerns:

* Katrina
  1. I have started a new job, so I may be working a lot in the beginning. Therefore, I may not be able to meet in person with group members, but I will check Slack and email regularly. 
  2. I have never use Github, so this is all very new to me; but I am willing to work hard and learn. 

* Lauren
  1. My biggest concern is team communication. I am worried about responding to my teammates in a timely and coherent manner, due to the fact that we are not communicating face-to-face, but rather through instant-messaging.
  2. I am also concerned about using GitHub. I have taken coding classes at the University before, but I have no experience with GitHub, so I hope that using this platform will not become a burden on our project.

## Conflict Resolution:
If team members cannot reach a compromise regarding a conflict or decision after positive and constructive debate, then the instructor will be informed of the conflict, and will be asked to advise the team members regarding the situation. 

## Missed Deadlines:
If a team member misses a deadline, then the team leader will send a positive reminder to that team member regarding the missed work. If, after 24 hours since the reminder was sent, the work remains undelivered, then the instructor will be notified of the late work. 

## Unacceptable Work:
If a team member submits work that falls below a standard quality of work (such as, if the work is not presented with proper formatting, does not meet adequate levels of professionality, fails to answer the assignment's questions or needs, or lacks overall clarity) decided on by the other remaining team members, then that team member will be positively and gently asked to edit and re-submit their work. If, after said team member has edited and re-submitted the work, the work remains unnacceptable and it is clear that the team member had not addressed the aforementioned issues, the remaining team members will approach the class instructor regarding the aforementioned team member's quality of work. However, we are a team, and these measures will only be taken if it is clear that positive communication has become inefficient towards reaching acceptable goals.
