# Team 1: Document Outline 

This file contains the analysis of the audience for the document as well as the general outline of the project. 

## Audience Profile
John Smith in the Writing 101 class at the University of Mississippi during the fall 2018 semester will have had few, if any, opportunities to explore open-source word processors. Throughout high school, he will have mostly used Microsoft Office, WordPad, or Google Docs to compose his academic documents. Entering college, John Smith realizes that while these word processors are still effective at composing documents, he finds himself becoming increasingly distracted by the internet and outside sources on his computer. 

John Smith is not new to technology. He has a grasp on how to run and operate Mac and Windows systems, though he might not have ever used an OS such as Linux/Ubuntu. Additionally, John Smith may not have a computer of his own, and may need to use a computer available to him at the university’s lab or library. With that in mind, he will need a program that can either run on a Mac or a Windows PC. 

John Smith is a college freshman, and is not yet confident in his ability to compose documentation on his own. He composed a basic research paper in high school, but never quite grasped the proper formatting for MLA citations and papers. Not only is John Smith interested in an open-source program that can help him stay focused and on-task, but he is also interested in an open-source program that can aid his writing and documentation skills. 

John Smith – of the millennial generation – prefers visual-heavy infographics, and bullets points that are short and precise. He prefers either bright, neon colors, or a minimalistic, monochrome scheme. John Smith is the primary audience for this document, for he will exclusively need this information to persuade him into using FocusWriter as a word processor.


## Project Outline
•	The documentation of our project will consist of shorter, more numerous files. Due to the nature of FocusWriter, these individual files will focus on specific aspects of the program (such as formatting, editing documents, printing, etc.).

•	Our documentation will rely heavily on the use of screenshots from within the FocusWriter program. Team members will download the program, and take screenshots for every step which demonstrates usage of the program’s numerous functions.

•	We will have no use for external sources within our documentation.

**_Project Title_**: How to use FocusWriter to Compose a Document

•	Document will be introduced through a short and informative file that describes the uses of FocusWriter, and how John Smith would benefit from it.

•	The names of prospective files, and the order of their presentation, follows:

Prospective Files:
1.	How to download and install FocusWriter
2.	How to create and start a new document
3.	How to change font style and size
4.	How to format paragraphs and margins
5.	How to use spell-check
6.	How to set “goals” and use word-count
7.	How to change FocusWriter themes
8.	How to manage files and sessions in FocusWriter
9.	How to save a FocusWriter document
10.	How to export FocusWriter documents to other word processors

•	Each file will be presented as a set of instructions, relying heavily on screenshots of the program to help guide John Smith’s understanding of the instructional steps. The “mouse pointer” in each screenshot will either highlight or point at the sections within FocusWriter which will be indicated in the instructable.

•	The document files will read as simplistic instructions on how to specifically use FocusWriter, similar to how e-how and wiki-how instructables are formatted.
