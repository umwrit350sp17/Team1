# An Introduction to FocusWriter
FocusWriter is an open-source program that offers a distraction-free, word-processing environment. The program is best used for writing and drafting the initial stages of a document, especially for those who are prone to procrastination or becoming distracted. 

FocusWriter's unique, borderless theme allows one to focus entirely on the page. Borders have been removed, and one must use the ALT+TAB function to withdraw into other sections of their computer. This hinders the ability for one to mindlessly stop what they are doing, and peruse the internet or social media. FocusWriter, per its name, places the user's focus on their writing. 

The focus of this project is on how one would get started in using FocusWriter. In the following files, one will learn how to download and install FocusWriter, how to create documents in FocusWriter, how to open these documents in other word processors, and how to perform other FocusWriter tasks.

These files are organized into 10 sections, numbered 1-9.2, with "9.2" (How to Export FocusWriter Documents) being an extension of section "9" (How to Save a FocusWriter Document). The sections are as follows:
